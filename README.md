1. Select asset in Project view and click `Ctrl+Alt+Shfit+F`.
2. Right click asset in Project view and select `Find References In Project` in popup menu.

## Feature

1. It's super fast on macOS and Windows if using SSD.
1. Show searching progress, max waiting time is 300s.
2. Show every reference in Console and you can click message to select object.
3. Show result in warning and summarize all references.

## Speed

### macOS

It only takes less than 2 seconds to complete search, it uses `mdfind` to utilize Spotlight index to speed up searching.

### Windows

It use the fastest `ripgrep` to search text and do a lot of optimization on file size and count.

So it would takes about 5 seconds to search ~700M and ~7000 files on SSD.

## Install

Add this line to your Packages/manifest.json:

    "com.github.idbrii.unity-findrefs": "https://github.com/idbrii/unity-findrefs.git#latest-release",

### macOS

Job done! It just uses the `mdfind` built in macOS and has no other dependencies.

### Windows

#### Scoop

If you're using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), install ripgrep:

```
scoop install ripgrep
```

rg.exe is now in your PATH and usable by unity-findrefs.


#### Manual

1. Download `ripgrep` from [Latest release Â· BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/latest) and extract `rg.exe` to `Tools\FindReferencesInProject2` directory.
2. Click `Unlock file` in `rg.exe` Properties, or you will find it takes too long time to start first time.

Note: It seems that `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` has a smaller size in `ripgrep` release page.
